# Luke Clewlow

An inspired and fast learning junior developer who loves building things. I have recently graduated from [Maker's Academy](www.makersacademy.com/) where I have spent 12 weeks intinsively learning to code. I'm looking to work in an Agile environment with positive people where I can continue to learn and develop my code craftmanship.

## Skills

### Test and Behavioural Driven Development

Through my time at Maker's Academy I have learnt good testing practices in Ruby and Javascript.
- Embracing SOLID principles in domain design
- RSpec, Cucumber, and Capybara for Unit and Feature testing in Ruby and Rails or Sinatra
- Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Selenium for Unit and Feature testing in JS/Node.js

### Attention to Detail

I learnt to be precise and make sure everything I input things correctly through my work in Finance. If something goes in to the system wrong in the first place it can be a long and costly process to discover and reverse this. Not dis-similar to the time taken looking for a missing semi-colon in javascript!

### Problem Solving

I got good at exploring problem spaces through my Philosophy degree. This required having to think through possible solutions and constructing a coherent system of argument. 

### Working with clients

I had the opportunity to work with a charity for my final project at Makers Academy. This meant involving them in the planning stages and continuously keeping communication open so that we could quickly iterate and give them a working prototype as close to their specifications as possible.


## Education

### Makers Academy - Dec'14 to Mar'15
