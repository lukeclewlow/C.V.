# Luke Clewlow

An enthusiastic and fast learning junior developer who loves building things. After more than a few "Hello Worlds" I decided to learn programming full-time and have recently graduated from [Maker's Academy](www.makersacademy.com/) where I have spent 12 weeks intensively learning to code. I'm looking to work in an Agile environment with positive people where I can continue to learn and develop my code craftmanship.

## Skills

### Software Development

Through my time at Maker's Academy I have learnt good coding and testing practices in both Ruby and Javascript.

- Embracing SOLID principles
- Version control with Git
- Adopted Agile values, principles and practices
- Massive advocate of Test and Behavioural Driven Development
- RSpec, Cucumber, and Capybara for Unit and Feature testing in Ruby and Rails or Sinatra
- Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Selenium for Unit and Feature testing in JS/Node.js
- Since the course I have been focusing on learning more technologies and expanding my breadth of knowledge


### Problem Solving

I was drawn towards doing a Philosophy degree, and later Programming, largely through my love of problem solving.

- Debating in Philosophy involves thinking on your feet about possible solutions and constructing a coherent approach to that problem.
- You need to have a good conceptual overview of the problem space and the specific issues in order to tackle any philosophical question.
- I have experience in tackling problems in a professional environment. Whilst working as a Management Accountant I was constantly required to come up with new ways of extracting and making data accessible within the confines of the databases and reporting systems.

### Self-Starting Independent Learner

I have taught myself a lot of skills. I'm continually picking up new things and am fantastically driven to conquer new things!

- [Electronic Music Production](https://soundcloud.com/luk3nuk3m), I learnt from the ground up using only the internet and trial and error. Google is as helpful for this as it is for coding, and the experience isn't entirely different. There are many passionate people willing to offer their expertise to novices which is so great to see! 
- I taught myself piano, mainly just through perserverance and practice. I was already able to read music which helped, but the rest I have picked up myself.
- I have learnt basic joinery and built myself a rather nifty little table (although ever so slightly wobbly)!
- I circuit-bent an old yamaha keyboard to produce some weird and wonderful sounds, learning a little about electronics and hardware along the way.
- All of these things have taught me how to approach learning without the need for strict guidance. How to break vast problems into smaller chunks, how to navigate documentation and filter information when there is too much available.

### Communication and Team Work

I am good at working with a team, sharing knowledge and expanding and building upon my own to get the most out of working together.

- I managed a small team at Precise, my previous company. They might begin work as unskilled and learn on the job, but I found that everyone had something to bring to the team right from the start and it was just a matter of letting their skills flourish, a lot of this was down to understanding different peoples motivations and working positively with those.
- I had the opportunity to work with a charity for my final project at Makers Academy. This meant involving them in the planning stages and continuously keeping communication open so that we could quickly iterate and give them a working prototype as close to their specifications as possible.
- I have been pair programming every week throughout my time at Makers Academy. This teaches you how best to work with lots of different people, and how to be more productive as a team of two than you would be on your own.

### Interests

- Building things 
- [Electronic Music Production](https://soundcloud.com/luk3nuk3m)
- Writing Elegant Code
- Technology and the future
- Lifelong learning
- Recently involved building [this app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/ticklefluff/id965582073?mt=8), I was involved in the entire process which was an awesome experience but wrote all the music and the sound effects myself (yes, I am the voice of ticklefluff!)

## Education

### Makers Academy - Dec'14 to Mar'15
